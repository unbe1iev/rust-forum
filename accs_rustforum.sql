It\'s a DayZ style game mode. It elevates the survival aspect, and makes items and resources much more precious. You can still harvest resources like Wood, or the occasional Ore Node you may find.

If you farmed all wipe and were lucky enough to find some uranium (or something of the sort) you could do some science with it, add some isotopes etc and get it activated. You could then create a nuke and it\'d take some plane to fly it high up into the sky and drop it down.\r\nThis could add in lots of new pvp and goals for rust players.', 'tips'),
